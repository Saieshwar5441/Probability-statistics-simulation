# Probability-statistics-simulation

This project applies core concepts of probability and statistics using real-world-inspired data simulations and Python-based modeling. The goal is to bridge theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice using tools like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

## Objective

To explore, simulate, and analyze various statistical distributions and theorems including:
- Descriptive statistics & data visualization
- Classical distributions (Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Exponential)
- Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- Markov Chains and Steady-State Behavior
- Monte Carlo & Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for estimation
